# v1.5.5 Fixes and Notes

Pwnagotchi v1.5.5 has a number of gotchas that need to be patched in order for it to work properly. See release [here](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/releases/tag/v1.5.5).

## General Notes

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
The config file is located at                   `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml`
The log file is located at                      `/var/log/pwnagotchi.log`
You can monitor the logs in real time with      `logs` or `tail -f /var/log/pwnagotchi.log`
Check that pwnagotchi is running with           `systemctl status pwnagotchi`
Restart the device in MANU mode with            `systemctl restart pwnagotchi`
Restart the device in AUTO mode                 `touch /root/.pwnagotchi-auto && systemctl restart pwnagotchi`
View where pwnagotchi lives                     `pip3 show pwnagotchi`
Spoiler, pwnagotchi lives here                  `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi`
Default plugins live here                       `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi/plugins/default`
Custom plugins are istalled here                `/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/installed-plugins/`
Check the battery status                        `battery` or `python3 ~/UPS_Lite_V1.3_CW2015.py`

## (Re)connect to the Device

When you setup the device you should have followed the configuration steps [here](https://pwnagotchi.ai/configuration/#connect-to-your-pwnagotchi) to setup the network interface that would allow you to ssh into the pi.

Make sure all WiFi and Ethernet is disabled on your host computer before attempting to plug in / connect to the pi.

You should be able to ping the device with `ping 10.0.0.2` and connect to it with `ssh pi@pwnagotchi.local`, or if you changed its name already, `ssh pi@whateverYouNamedIt.local`.

If you can't you may need to try resetting the configuration. If you are not able to connect to the device (cannot ping or ssh) try removing the interface and recreating it.

Make sure that you don't have a VPN enabled or any AntiVirus software enabled that could interfere with the connection.

### Remove the old configuration

To begin, power down and unplug the device.

From a terminal run `ifconfig` and look for the device near the bottom of the table. You will recognize it because it will have a line like `inet 10.0.0.1 {...}`. Note its name, such as `en8` or similar.

Now, from within `System Settings > Network` you will find the device labeled as `RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget`, and since your pwnagotchi isn't plugged in it should say "Not Connected". Right click on it and choose "Delete Service". When prompted, select that you _do_ want it to show up in the list when reconnected.

Head back to the terminal again and run `ifconfig`. At the bottom of the table you should see that the device (`en8` or whatever you saw before) no longer shows in the list.

(Partial) success! Now let's add the configuration anew.

### Add the configuration again

Disable Wi-Fi and any ethernet (or other network connections) on your computer.

Plug the device into your computer using a good usb cable that you know has data lines. Make sure you plug it into the interior usb port. The outside one is only for power.

Give it a minute for the device to boot up. Run `ifconfig` again and you should now see a new record in the table, possibly with the same `en8` name as before. But notably, this time you'll see something like `inet 169.254.111.94 netmask 0xffff0000 broadcast 169.254.255.255` rather than `inet 10.0.0.1 {...}`. This means that the device has been recognized by the system and has a new ip address, `169.254.111.94`, or whatever. That's good, because it means it is no longer using the old configuration that we removed.

Now, let's add the configuration again. Open up `Systm Settings > Network` and find the `RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget` device that should show up. Rather than a green cicrle that says "Connected", you should see a yellow circle indicating it has a self-assigned ip.

Click on it and choose `Details...` to configure the settings. As the original instructions indicate, chose the following settings:

```
IPv4 Configured         Manually
IP address              10.0.0.1
Subnet mask             255.255.255.0
```

And you shouldn't need to set anything else. Click "Apply" and you should see the yellow circle go green and the text change to "Connected".

Head back to the terminal and run `ifconfig` a final time, and you will see that your `en8` interface now says `inet 10.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 10.0.0.255`, matching the settings we configured (Note: `ff` is `255` in hex).

At this point, you should be able to `ping 10.0.0.2` and `ssh pi@yourPwnName.local`. If you can't, then I can't help you.

Once you are connected, you can turn your Wi-Fi back on on your host computer. And, if you need to access Wi-Fi on the device, run the connectivity sharing script documented [here](#enable-internet).

## Support Waveshare V3 Display

[Amazon Link](https://a.co/d/2lTqyDy)

The current iteration of Waveshare displays is version 3, which is not compatible out of the gate with v1.5.5. V3 support has been added to the project but has not yet made its way into a release, so to backfill support in v1.5.5 you can copy the changes from [this PR](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/commit/91e95cede0b17aeb1a09f13930869baa245a5616) directly into the pwnagotchi python package.

You can find where the package is located by running `pip3 show pwnagotchi`, which should show that the package is installed at `/usr/lib/python3/dist-package/pwnagotchi`. So, switch into that directory and update all of the files. You could try copying the new files over, but for some reason that didn't work for me but copying just the changes from this PR did work.

Once the changes are copied over, update `/etc/pwnagotchi/config.toml` to include `ui.display.type = "waveshare_3"` and then restart the service `systemctl restart pwnagotchi` and the display should now work.

## Support UPS Lite v1.3

https://www.tindie.com/products/rachel/ups-lite-for-raspberry-pi-zero/
https://github.com/linshuqin329/UPS-Lite/blob/master/UPS-Lite_V1.3_CW2015/Instructions%20for%20UPS-Lite%20V1.3.pdf

### Reading Data

Out of the box the `ups_lite` plugin doesn't support UPS Lite v1.3. Specifically because v1.3 has a different I2C address. We can fix this by updating the address in `/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pwnagotchi/plugins/default/ups_lite.py`. Specifically, make sure to read from `CW2015_ADDRESS  = 0x62` for both voltage and capacity, and for the voltage reading the calculation should be `return swapped * 0.305 / 1000`. It may not be necesarry, but in the `__init__` you should also wake up the CW2015 chip by calling `self._bus.write_word_data(CW2015_ADDRESS, CW2015_REG_MODE, 0x30)` where `CW2015_REG_MODE = 0x0a`.

### Charging Indicator

You can also add `GPIO.setwarnings(False)` before checking if charging to ensure no GPIO warnings are logged. If you plan on using the charge indicator you must bridge the two split pads on the back side of the board.

### Caution

Make sure not to enable `main.plugins.ups_lite.shutdown` until you are certain that the capacity is being read correctly. Otherwise the board will shut itself down as soon as the UPS Lite plugin loads.

## Add DS3231 RTC

By default the RPi time will be incorrect and so will the time on the logs. We can fix this by soldering on a DS3231 RTC over I2C. Once the RTC is soldered on we need to tell the RPi to use the RTC as its clock. Follow [this Adafruit guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-rtc-time) in order to enable the hardware clock on the RPi. Once that is done we still need to set the actual time on the RPi.

By default your RPi won't have internet access, so we will need to set the time manually.

On your computer, open a web browser and open the console and type the following:

```js
function getTime(shift = 0) {
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const iso = currentDate.toISOString();
    const timeParts = iso.split(".");
    const firstPart = timeParts[0];
    const originalSeconds = firstPart.slice(firstPart.length - 2);
    const adjustedSeconds = Number(originalSeconds) + shift;
    const fixedFirstPart =
        firstPart.slice(0, firstPart.length - 2) + adjustedSeconds;
    const fixedTime = fixedFirstPart + "." + timeParts[1];
    const ele = document.createElement("input");
    ele.value = fixedTime;
    document.body.appendChild(ele);
    ele.select();
    document.execCommand("copy");
    document.body.removeChild(ele);
    return fixedTime;
}

getTime(5);
```

This will get the current time (plus 5 seconds) as an ISO timestamp and copy it to your clipboard. While SSH into the pwnagotchi, after 5 seconds type the following, pasting the ISO timestamp in:

```bash
sudo date -s "{your copied timestamp}"
```

If you time it correctly you should now have the correct time displayed on your RPi when you run the `date` command. Set this time to the RTC by running `sudo hwclock -w`.

As a final step, make sure that you set the timezone on your pi so that it shows the correct time based off of the UTC time you just set. Run `sudo raspi-config` and go to `Localisation Options` and set the `Timezone`.

## Fix the AI

Apparently v1.5.5 was shipped with broken AI. When you start the device it should start in `Auto` mode (aka dumb mode) and run a default attack sequence while it is waiting for the A2C model to load. It should load after about 10 minutes and then switch from `Auto` to `AI` mode. However, if it never switches into `AI` mode it's probably because the model can't be loaded. Fixing this is fairly involved. First, `cat /var/log/pwnagotchi.log` and look for errors. If you see something like the following then you should try this fix:

```bash
[ERROR] error while starting AI (numpy.ndarray size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 44 from C header, got 40 from PyObject)
```

Basically the version of `numpy` that was shipped is incompatible with the base model and we need to upgrade numpy. You can read about it [here](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/issues/992). In order to update `numpy` we first need to enable internet on the RPi.

### Enable Internet

With the device plugged into your computer via its data port (the inside micro port) and while you are connected to it over ssh, we can share our computer's internet by running the share script.

Note: You must run this script _on the host computer_, not on the pwnagotchi.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/macos_connection_share.sh
```

You ought to see something like this:

```bash
sharing connecting from upstream interface en0 to usb interface en8 ...
net.inet.ip.forwarding: 0 -> 1
No ALTQ support in kernel
ALTQ related functions disabled
pf enabled
pfctl: Use of -f option, could result in flushing of rules
present in the main ruleset added by the system at startup.
See /etc/pf.conf for further details.

No ALTQ support in kernel
ALTQ related functions disabled
```

Make sure you don't have a VPN enabled. While SSH into the RPi try `ping google.com` and it still won't work even if the internet sharing is setup correctly. We need to update the name server.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

and change the nameserver to `8.8.8.8`. Note that this will reset on boot, so you will need to update this each time you need to share the internet. Try pinging google again and you should now get packets back. Hooray.

### Increase Swapfile

Downloading `numpy` will require is to compile on the RPi which will take a very long time. In order not to go insane we need to bump the swapfile so that the Pi has more memory. The process outlined below comes from [here](https://nebl.io/neblio-university/enabling-increasing-raspberry-pi-swap/).

1. Stop the swap: `sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff`
2. Change the `CONF_SWAPSIZE` from `CONF_SWAPSIZE=100` to `CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024` in `sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile`
3. Initialize the swapfile with `sudo dphys-swapfile setup`
4. Start the swap with `sudo dphys-swapfile swapon`

After building `numpy` go back and set the swap back to 100.

### Upgrade numpy

Now that we have internet and have increased the swapsize we can finally upgrade numpy. This will take a very long time, so make sure to install it using `--verbose` so that we can monitor the progress.

1. SSH into the pi
2. Start a screen session so that if we get disconnected for some reason we can get back into it: `screen bash` (to exit, ctrl-a and then d. To rejoin `screen -r`. To kill the session ctrl-d)
3. Start the install: `sudo pip3 install --verbose --upgrade numpy --no-cache-dir`
4. Once it successfully installs, go back and reset the swap size

You should be good to go now!
Restart the service and boot it into Auto mode and watch the logs and you should see that the AI model now loads after about 10 minutes: `sudo touch /root/.pwnagotchi-auto && systemctl restart pwnagotchi && tail -f /var/log/pwnagotchi.log`

## Add a Shutdown Button

Solder a 6mm pushbutton to between pin GPIO20 and GND (the spacing works perfectly).

Then add the following to your config:

```bash
main.plugins.gpio_shutdown.enabled = true
main.plugins.gpio_shutdown.gpio = 20
```

## Add Haptic Feedback

Get some [mini vibration motors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071WYG59X) to add haptic feedback. Build [this circuit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-13-dc-motors).

Checkout [the plugin](./pwnagotchi/plugins/custom/haptic.py) and then set in the config:

```bash
main.plugins.haptic.enabled = true
main.plugins.haptic.gpio = 23
```
